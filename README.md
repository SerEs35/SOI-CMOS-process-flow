# SOI-CMOS-process-flow
-------------------------

This project is about the design of a Silicon-over-Oxide CMOS process flow. 

The project is divided in two stages. The first stage consist on designing the transistors, starting from hand calculations. The second stage consist on further simulations and determining the process flow on a SOI wafer. 

The simulations and characterization of the CMOS model in SOI were performed in MINIMOS and in TSuprem-4.
